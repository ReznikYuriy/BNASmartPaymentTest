Implement an algorithm to find the shortest path on a 2D map. The map is represented as a matrix (0 – passable cell, 1 – wall).
Conditions:
Input data:
grid – a two-dimensional array (0 – passable cell, 1 – wall).
start – coordinates [x, y] of the starting point.
end – coordinates [x, y] of the destination.
Movement is possible only in 4 directions (up, down, left, and right).
If a path is found, return a list of coordinates ([x, y]) and the number of steps that
lead from start to end. If not, return null.
Do not use libraries.
